- 👋 Hi, I’m @RhezouaniMath, and I work as a software developer at Sogyo. At Sogyo I have been trained in programming (Java), OOP, front-end technologies, databases, web infrastructure, MVC and CI/CD. Right now, I'm learning to program in Scala. I have a background in mathematics (MSc degree from Leiden University).
- 👀 I’m interested in mathematics (especially probability and statistics) and software engineering.
- 🌱 At Sogyo I have been working on assignments from the Sogyo Academy. These assignments helped me to further develop my software engineering skills. One of these assignments was to program Mancala. A repository for the Mancala game can be found on my GitHub page. If you want to use the code for the Mancala game, please contact the Sogyo organisation: https://www.sogyo.nl/contact .
- 🌱My master thesis is about money laundering in casinos and the use of the d'Alembert system in roulette. I used MATLAB to do simulations for this master thesis project.
- 💞️ You can find the MATLAB files for the master thesis project on my GitHub page. Please feel free to use them. 
- 📫 You can contact me (Hamid Rhezouani MSc) via electronic mail: hamid_pet AT hotmail DOT com

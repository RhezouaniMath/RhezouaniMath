- 👋 Hi, I’m @RhezouaniMath, and I started to work as a software developer at Sogyo. Right now, I'm being trained in programming, OOP, front-end technologies, databases, web infrastructure, MVC and CI/CD. I have a background in mathematics (MSc degree from Leiden University).
- 👀 I’m interested in mathematics (especially probability and statistics) and software engineering.
- 🌱 Right now, I'm working on assignments from the Sogyo Academy. These assignments will help me to (further) develop my software engineering skills. I will post some code on my GitHub page (at least a repository for the Mancala game). If you want to use this code, please contact the Sogyo organisation: https://www.sogyo.nl/contact .
- 🌱My master thesis is about money laundering in casinos and the use of the d'Alembert system in roulette. I used MATLAB to do simulations for this master thesis project.
- 💞️ You can find the MATLAB files for the master thesis project on my GitHub page. Please feel free to use them.
